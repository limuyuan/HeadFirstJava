Exercises and bullet points of Head First Java, 2nd Version

I have to figure out a way to upload my exercise codes...

It's a lot of work to do COPY-AND-PASTE individually because my company can't upload files directly...

I just tried and I can push via TortoiseGit! Amazing!

And this time I'll try Atom...Atom seems doesn't work.
